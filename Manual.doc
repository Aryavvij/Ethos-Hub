Technical Operations Manual
  
1. Ethos Hub (The Dashboard)

Purpose: Serves as the high-level command center and data aggregator for the entire ecosystem.
Mechanics: Uses relational SQL queries to pull "snapshots" of data from the other modules based on the current system date.
Main Feature: The Today’s Briefing box, which provides a filtered view of the current day's classes, gym split, and focus goals in one glance.

2. Iron Clad (Performance Lab)

Purpose: Tracks physical strength development and the principle of progressive overload.
Mechanics: Implements a dual-table architecture where the exercise_library maintains all-time Personal Bests and the workout_logs stores historical volume.
Main Feature: The Work Capacity Trend, a visualization of "Total Tonnage" (Weight×Reps×Sets) to measure true muscular endurance and growth.

3. Neural Lock (Deep Work)

Purpose: Facilitates high-intensity, distraction-free focus sessions.
Mechanics: Utilizes a Python-based stopwatch engine that calculates elapsed time in the application cache before committing the final duration to the database.
Main Feature: The Neural Momentum Graph, which displays a 30-day area chart of focus minutes to identify cognitive peak patterns.

4. Academic Trajectory (The Blueprint)

Purpose: Manages long-term strategic initiatives and project milestones.
Mechanics: Uses a hierarchical data structure to organize tasks by Category, Priority, and Timeframe.
Main Feature: The Interactive Sunburst Map, which provides a 360-degree view of project completion percentages across different life domains.

5. Weekly Planner (Execution Grid)

Purpose: Handles micro-task management and daily accountability.
Mechanics: Features a 7-column grid layout with "Absolute Grid Locking" via CSS to ensure the UI remains symmetrical on all devices.
Main Feature: Custom SVG Progress Rings that dynamically fill as tasks are checked off, providing immediate psychological feedback on daily success.

6. Monthly Events (Calendar)

Purpose: Tracks fixed-date commitments, deadlines, and social obligations.
Mechanics: Uses the Python calendar module to generate a dynamic date matrix that pulls events assigned to specific timestamps.
Main Feature: Status-Based Highlighting, where pending events are flagged in Red and completed events in Green, allowing for a clear visual heat-map of the month.

7. Habit Lab (Consistency Tracker)

Purpose: Monitors daily recurring behaviors and atomic habits.
Mechanics: Pivots row-based SQL data into a horizontal monthly grid, allowing for efficient mass-updates in a single view.
Main Feature: The Performance Matrix, which calculates a daily percentage score of habit completion to visualize "winning" vs. "losing" days.

8. Financial Hub (Capital Management)

Purpose: Orchestrates personal budgeting, spending analysis, and debt reduction.
Mechanics: Employs aggregate SQL functions (SUM, COALESCE) to calculate the delta between planned budgets and actual expenditures.
Main Feature: The Net Debt Tracker, which provides a specialized interface to monitor loan repayments and total financial liability in real-time.

9. The Pantheon (Knowledge Repository)

Purpose: Acts as a dual-mode archive for structured comparisons and deep-form note-taking.
Mechanics: Features a "Dual-Input" tab system that allows for the creation of either dynamic ranking tables or markdown-supported text blocks.
Main Feature: The Universal Search Engine, which filters through all categories and note titles to find stored knowledge instantly.
