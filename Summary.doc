Technical Project Summary

The Ethos System is a full-stack personal resource planning (PRP) application developed to integrate disparate life-management data into a single, cohesive ecosystem. The developer utilized a modern Python-based stack combined with relational database management to solve the problem of "data fragmentation" in personal productivity.

Technical Architecture & Implementation
Relational Database Integrity: The system is powered by a PostgreSQL backend. The developer implemented a normalized schema that supports multi-user partitioning through unique identifier keys. This ensures data persistence and prevents collision between concurrent user sessions.
Stateful Multi-Page Routing: Leveraging Streamlit’s session state, the developer engineered a secure authentication layer and a persistent global sidebar. This ensures that user identity and session context are maintained across all nine independent modules without requiring re-authentication.
Custom UI/UX Engineering: To move beyond standard framework limitations, the developer utilized CSS Injection (Flexbox and Grid) and Raw SVG Rendering. Notable examples include the custom-coded circular progress gauges and the absolute-lock grid system in the Weekly Planner, which ensures visual stability across various browser aspect ratios.
Asynchronous Data Synchronization: The "Commit Entire Session" logic in the Iron Clad and Habit modules demonstrates an advanced understanding of Batch Processing. Multiple dataframes are processed and "upserted" into the database in a single transaction, optimizing performance and reducing server-side latency.
Advanced Analytics & Visualization: The developer integrated Plotly’s graphing engine to render interactive, non-static visualizations. Complex charts, such as Sunburst hierarchies for project management and Area charts for focus-time trends, were customized with the system's "Ethos Green" brand identity to provide a premium, unified user experience.
Professional Conclusion

This project demonstrates the developer's ability to bridge the gap between backend data architecture and frontend user experience. By creating an integrated system that handles everything from financial tracking to real-time stopwatches, the developer has showcased a high level of proficiency in Python, SQL, and interface design.
